Every sandboxed runner builds its `docker run` flags here. Keeping this in a

drift, and the drift is invisible — the runner that quietly lost
`--cap-drop=ALL` still passes all its behavioural tests.

Changing this function changes the guarantee for ALL runners.

    - Windows: `os.getuid`/`os.getgid` don't exist, and Docker Desktop does
      not map a host identity into the Linux container the way a native
      Linux daemon does — there is no host uid to pass. Omitting `--user`

    passes through byte-identical (this must not change — see the plan's
    Global Constraints). A Windows path (`C:\\Users\\phong\\...`) contains
    both backslashes AND a drive-letter colon, which is ambiguous with the
    src:dst separator itself — that raw form is what breaks the split.

    Detecting "is this a Windows path" by `isinstance(..., PureWindowsPath)`
    rather than `sys.platform == "win32"` is deliberate: a real `Path`
    passed in while running on Windows already IS a `WindowsPath`, a
    `PureWindowsPath` subclass, so the same branch handles the live case
    and lets tests exercise it on any host with a synthetic
    `PureWindowsPath` — no `sys.platform` gate to bit-rot in CI.

    Rewrites `C:\\Users\\phong\\work` to `/c/Users/phong/work`: lowercase
