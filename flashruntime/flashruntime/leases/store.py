"""Storage interface for the lease manager, plus the in-memory reference
implementation.

The `LeaseStore` protocol is the seam between the pure state machine
(`manager.py`) and durability: the in-memory store backs unit tests and
embedded use; the FlashRuntime service wires a SQLite/Postgres store behind
the same five methods. Keeping the interface this small is deliberate — the
*semantics* (who may claim, when a commit wins) live entirely in the
manager, never in a store, so every backend behaves identically.
