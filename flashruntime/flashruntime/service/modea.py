"""Mode A over HTTP: the lease coordinator, node registry, and local
artifact hosting for the self-hosted profile.

This module makes the pure-library pieces reachable by remote workers:

- **Leases** — HTTP verbs over the `LeaseManager` (claim / heartbeat /
  complete / fail) plus a background sweep. FlashNode's executor is the
  intended client, but anything that speaks the protocol can pull work.
- **Node registry** — minimal register/heartbeat/list so a self-hosted
  coordinator knows its workers (FlashML Cloud fronts this with join codes
  and trust tiers in the managed product; the wire models are the same).
- **Local artifacts** — PUT/GET raw bytes under a local directory, so
  shared data (datasets in, trial outputs back) needs no cloud and no
  MinIO: the coordinator *is* the artifact host for the local loop. Keys
  are sha256-verified on upload; the same `artifact://` URIs used by the
  cloud stores apply, keeping job specs portable.

Job → task expansion lives here too: a JobSpec with
`execution.backend: leases` and `workload.type: hyperparameter_search`
becomes N `TaskSpec`s whose payloads carry the executor contract
(module, params, input artifact keys, output prefix).
