"""flash.submit(): run a CommandWorkload locally and hand back a Run.

The execution model is compile → launch → wait → collect, once per Mode A
param set (mirroring the M0 engine's replay model). Sequential-by-design
keeps collection correct (a trial's outputs are copied out of the source
dir before the next trial can overwrite them). Service submission is a
different door: `workloads.command.to_jobspec()` POSTed to the coordinator.

`wait=True` (default) drives that loop inline and returns a finished Run —
byte-for-byte the old synchronous behavior. `wait=False` returns the Run
immediately and drives the loop on a daemon thread, so the caller can watch
it live. Either way the Run mirrors itself to `<output_dir>/run.json` after
every state change (the `viewer_v1` contract Task 6 renders from disk).
