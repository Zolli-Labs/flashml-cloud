"""FlashRuntime — open fault-tolerant distributed ML runtime.

A clean, pure-Python core (`pip install flashruntime` brings only pydantic):

1. **Strategy planner** — decide *how* a job should run, with the math shown:

       import flashruntime as flash

       report = flash.plan(flash.PlanRequest(
           workload=flash.TransformerFineTune(model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B", method="lora"),
           resources=flash.Resources(gpus=4, gpu_type="RTX4090"),
           objective=flash.Objective(mode="balanced", deadline_minutes=240),
       ))
       print(flash.render(report))

2. **Lease manager** (`flashruntime.leases`) — the Mode A reliability core:
   claim → heartbeat → expiry → requeue → idempotent commit, as a plain
   state machine anyone can embed (the FlashML coordinator is one consumer).

3. **Checkpoint catalog** (`flashruntime.checkpoint`) — manifests with
   parts-first / manifest-last commit: a partial checkpoint can never look
   valid, and recovery selects only verified, topology-compatible state.

4. **Recovery policy** (`flashruntime.recovery`) — the typed failure
   taxonomy and a versioned, deterministic action table. No agents, no
   guesswork: same failure + same policy version ⇒ same action.

Infrastructure integrations are opt-in extras, never core imports:
`[service]` FastAPI coordinator + CLI job commands · `[k8s]` KubeRay
backend · `[artifacts]`/`[oss]` MinIO / Alibaba OSS stores ·
`[sklearn]` numpy + scikit-learn for the built-in task-module examples
(`flashml_workloads/`).

    This is the plan→execution bridge (HANDBOOK §6 "known conscious
    debts"). The designed pipeline, so the implementer starts from the
    intended shape rather than inventing one:

    1. Freeze & record: the plan's `plan_id` is stamped on the job attempt
       (every incident must answer "what did we think, and why").
    2. Translate: for `workload_mode == "independent_tasks"`, build a
       lease-backend JobSpec via the matching `recipes.WorkloadRecipe` and
       POST it to the coordinator (`coordinator_url` or
       FLASHML_RUNTIME_API). For `coordinated_training`,
       `strategies.compiler_for(plan).compile(plan)` →
       `launchers` by `plan.launcher` → launch and watch.
    3. Return a run handle exposing job_id, state polling, and the ledger
       event stream — mirroring `LaunchHandle` semantics.

    Until then this raises NotImplementedError so callers fail loudly at
    the boundary instead of half-running: today you plan with
    `flash.plan()` and submit the JobSpec yourself (see
    e2e/test_local_loop.py for the manual pattern).
