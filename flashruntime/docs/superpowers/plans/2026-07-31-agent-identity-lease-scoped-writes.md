# Agent Identity and Lease-Scoped Writes Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give every worker machine its own revocable credential, and confine what a machine may write to the tasks it currently holds a lease on — so a public coordinator cannot be used by one volunteer to overwrite another job's results.

**Architecture:** The coordinator gains a pluggable `NodeAuthenticator` seam (open by default, so the self-hosted profile is unchanged) that resolves a bearer token to a `node_id`. Every artifact and checkpoint **write** then derives its permitted key prefixes from that node's *live leases* and rejects anything else with 403. flashnode gains a credential store and sends its token on every request.

**Tech Stack:** Python ≥3.10, FastAPI, pydantic, pytest.

This is **Plan 2 of 7** for M1, implementing §5.2 and §6.1–§6.2 of
`flashml-cloud/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-deployed-multi-user-poc-design.md`.

## Why this plan gates every other one

`HANDOFF.md` risk #2 and the 2026-07-29 deferred follow-up #1: `PUT /v1alpha1/artifacts/{key}` (`service/modea.py:503`) and the checkpoint endpoints accept **any key from any caller**, with no authentication whatsoever — only `_safe_key` path containment and a size cap. The sha256 commit check is no defense, because the attacker supplies both the file and the hash.

The Plan 1 whole-branch review sharpened this: the authoritative federated-averaging model is written to `jobs/{job_id}/round-{r:03d}/weights.json`, a predictable key in that same writable namespace. One volunteer can overwrite **everyone's** model. That is a different and worse thing than the accepted "a node may lie about its own result" gap.

Standing guidance is "do not put the current coordinator on a public IP for longer than a demo." **Nothing in M1 may face the internet until this plan lands.**

## Global Constraints

- **The self-hosted profile must keep working unchanged.** `flashruntime/CLAUDE.md` rule 4: "the runtime must stay useful without the cloud — self-hosted local coordinator is a first-class mode, not a demo shim." With no authenticator configured, behavior is exactly as today. Every existing test must pass untouched.
- **Security fields fail closed** (`CLAUDE.md` rule 3). Where a value is absent or type-confused, deny.
- **Reads stay open; only writes are scoped.** The driver reads other tasks' outputs and agents download shared inputs — scoping reads would break both. Read-side authorization is the cloud API's job (Plan 3), by job ownership.
- flashruntime imports nothing from flashnode or flashml-cloud, ever (`CLAUDE.md` rule 1).
- Never run the coordinator with more than one uvicorn worker (`HANDOFF.md` risk #5).
- **Run tests with the venv on `PATH`**, or `test_examples_e2e.py::test_sklearn_sweep_end_to_end` fails spuriously (`LocalLauncher` spawns a bare `python`):

      cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest

  Inner loop (the torchrun tests take minutes):

      PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q \
        --ignore=tests/test_examples_e2e.py --ignore=tests/test_gpu_e2e.py

- **Baselines — do not reduce:** flashruntime **417 passed**, flashnode **75 passed, 1 skipped, 4 deselected**, workspace e2e **7 passed**.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/auth.py` (new) | `NodeAuthenticator` protocol, `OpenAuthenticator`, `StaticTokenAuthenticator`, `authenticator_from_env()`. No FastAPI, no lease knowledge — pure token → node_id. |
| `flashruntime/flashruntime/leases/manager.py` (modify) | `live_leases_for_node(node_id) -> set[tuple[str, str]]` — the authorization *fact* the service asks for. |
| `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/modea.py` (modify) | Resolve the caller, scope `PUT /artifacts`, fail-closed startup guard. |
| `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/checkpoints.py` (modify) | Same scoping for `parts` and `commit`. |
| `flashnode/flashnode/identity/credentials.py` (new) | Read/write `~/.flashnode/credentials.json` at 0600. |
| `flashnode/flashnode/agent/cli.py` (modify) | `flashnode login --token`, `flashnode logout`. |
| `flashnode/flashnode/executor/client.py` (modify) | Send `Authorization: Bearer` when a credential exists. |

Keeping `auth.py` free of lease knowledge is the decomposition that matters: *who is calling* and *what may they write* are separate questions, tested separately, and Plan 3 replaces only the first.

### Task 1: The authenticator seam

**Files:**
- Create: `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/auth.py`
- Test: `flashruntime/tests/test_service_auth.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `NodeAuthenticator` — Protocol with `authenticate(token: str | None) -> str | None` (returns `node_id`, or `None` to deny) and property `enforcing: bool`
  - `OpenAuthenticator()` — `enforcing = False`; `authenticate` always returns `None`
  - `StaticTokenAuthenticator(tokens: dict[str, str])` — `enforcing = True`; maps token → node_id
  - `authenticator_from_env(env: dict[str, str] | None = None) -> NodeAuthenticator`
  - `AuthConfigError(RuntimeError)`

`FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS` holds `node_id:token` pairs, comma-separated. Absent ⇒ `OpenAuthenticator`.

    assert a.authenticate("tok-b") == "node-b"

apart is what lets the cloud replace authentication (Plan 3) without touching
authorization.

Default is OPEN: `flashruntime/CLAUDE.md` rule 4 makes the self-hosted local
coordinator a first-class mode, and requiring credentials on a laptop would
break it. An operator exposing the coordinator turns enforcement on with
FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS, and FLASHML_REQUIRE_NODE_AUTH=1 makes startup fail closed
if they forget (see service/modea.py).

### Task 2: `live_leases_for_node` — the authorization fact

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashruntime/flashruntime/leases/manager.py`
- Test: `flashruntime/tests/test_leases_scope.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from Task 1.
- Produces: `LeaseManager.live_leases_for_node(node_id: str, now: datetime | None = None) -> set[tuple[str, str]]` — `(job_id, task_id)` for every lease this node currently holds that is still live.

Expiry matters: a node whose lease lapsed must lose write access immediately, or a straggler could overwrite the result of whoever reclaimed its task.

**API facts, verified in the source — do not assume otherwise:**
- `LeaseManager.__init__(store=None, on_event=None)` takes **no clock**. Time is
  passed per call as `now: datetime | None` (see `claim`, `heartbeat`, `sweep`).
  Tests control time by passing `now=`, not by injecting a clock.
- Tasks are registered with `add_task(spec, now=None)` — there is no
  `submit_tasks`.
- `Lease` (`protocol/v1alpha1.py:355`) carries `lease_id, task_id, job_id,
  node_id, attempt_number, deadline: datetime, payload`. The expiry field is
  **`deadline`**, and it is a `datetime` — there is no `expires_at`.
- **`LeaseManager._is_live(record, lease, now)` already exists**
  (`manager.py:281`) and is the canonical liveness predicate: it checks the
  lease is still the active one, `deadline > now`, and the record is `LEASED`.
  **Reuse it.** Duplicating expiry logic is how the two copies drift apart, and
  the record-state check is one this task would otherwise forget.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# flashruntime/tests/test_leases_scope.py
"""Which (job, task) pairs may a node write to right now?

Time is controlled by passing `now=` to the manager — LeaseManager takes no
clock; every time-sensitive method accepts a `now: datetime | None`.
"""

    result of whoever reclaimed its task."""
    manager.add_task(_task("job-1", "task-000"), now=T0)
    manager.claim("node-a", now=T0)
    assert manager.live_leases_for_node("node-a", now=T0) == {("job-1", "task-000")}
    later = T0 + timedelta(seconds=31)
    assert manager.live_leases_for_node("node-a", now=later) == set()


def test_a_completed_task_leaves_scope(manager):
    """_is_live also requires the record to still be LEASED, so a task whose
    result was already accepted stops being writable — otherwise a second
    upload could replace a committed artifact."""
    manager.add_task(_task("job-1", "task-000"), now=T0)
    lease = manager.claim("node-a", now=T0)
    manager.complete(lease.lease_id, output_sha256="0" * 64, now=T0)
    assert manager.live_leases_for_node("node-a", now=T0) == set()
```

If `complete()`'s signature differs, read `manager.py:165` and match it — the
assertion is what matters, not the call shape.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_leases_scope.py -v`
Expected: FAIL — `AttributeError: 'LeaseManager' object has no attribute 'live_leases_for_node'`

If the fixture itself errors, read `tests/test_leases.py` and match how it constructs `LeaseManager` and submits tasks — that file is the authority on the current constructor and clock-injection shape. Adjust the fixture, not the assertions.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add to `LeaseManager` in `flashruntime/flashruntime/leases/manager.py`, in the
"worker side" section beside `lease_info`:

```python
    def live_leases_for_node(
        self, node_id: str, now: datetime | None = None
    ) -> set[tuple[str, str]]:
        """(job_id, task_id) this node may currently write to.

        Delegates liveness to `_is_live` rather than re-testing `deadline`
        itself: that predicate also requires the lease to still be the active
        one and the record to still be LEASED, so a task whose result was
        already accepted stops being writable. Two copies of this rule would
        drift, and the drift would be a silent authorization hole.
        """
        now = now if now is not None else datetime.now(timezone.utc)
        scope: set[tuple[str, str]] = set()
        for record in self._store.leased():
            lease = record.active_lease
            if lease is None or lease.node_id != node_id:
                continue
            if not self._is_live(record, lease, now):
                continue
            scope.add((lease.job_id, lease.task_id))
        return scope
```

`datetime` and `timezone` are already imported at `manager.py:29`. If the module
has a shared `utcnow()` helper, prefer it over `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for
consistency — check `protocol/v1alpha1.py`, which defines one.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_leases_scope.py tests/test_leases.py tests/test_leases_sqlite.py -v`
Expected: 6 new passed; the two existing lease suites unchanged and green.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add flashruntime/leases/manager.py tests/test_leases_scope.py
git commit -m "feat(leases): live_leases_for_node, the write-authorization fact

Checks expiry inline rather than trusting the sweeper — a lease that lapsed
a millisecond ago must already be out of scope, or a straggler could
overwrite the result of whoever reclaimed its task."
```

### Task 3: Scope artifact writes to the caller's leases

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/modea.py` (`ModeAState.__init__` ~line 311, `put_artifact` ~line 503)
- Test: `flashruntime/tests/test_service_write_scope.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `authenticator_from_env`, `NodeAuthenticator` (Task 1); `live_leases_for_node` (Task 2).
- Produces: `ModeAState.authenticator`; helper `_authorize_write(state, manager, request, key) -> None` raising `HTTPException(401|403)`.

Rules, exactly:
- authenticator **not** enforcing → allow (self-hosted, unchanged).
- enforcing, no/bad token → **401**.
- enforcing, valid token, key outside every live lease prefix → **403**.
- allowed prefix for lease `(job, task)` is exactly `jobs/{job}/{task}/`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_service_write_scope.py -v`
Expected: the 401/403 tests FAIL (every write returns 200 today).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `ModeAState.__init__` (`modea.py` ~311), accept and store an authenticator, defaulting to the env-derived one:

```python
        from flashruntime.service.auth import NodeAuthenticator, authenticator_from_env
        self.authenticator: NodeAuthenticator = authenticator or authenticator_from_env()
```

Add beside `_safe_key`:

```python
def _bearer(request: Request) -> str | None:
    header = request.headers.get("Authorization") or ""
    scheme, _, token = header.partition(" ")
    return token.strip() if scheme.lower() == "bearer" and token.strip() else None


def _authorize_write(state, manager, request: Request, key: str) -> None:
    """Confine a write to the tasks this caller currently holds.

    Not enforcing ⇒ allow: the self-hosted profile predates credentials and
    must keep working (CLAUDE.md rule 4). When enforcing, an unknown caller is

    misconfigured agent from a misbehaving one.
    """
    if not state.authenticator.enforcing:
        return
    node_id = state.authenticator.authenticate(_bearer(request))
    if node_id is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="invalid or missing node token")
    # Trailing slash is load-bearing: without it `jobs/j/trial-000extra/...`
    # would satisfy a `jobs/j/trial-000` prefix test.
    allowed = [f"jobs/{job}/{task}/" for job, task in manager.live_leases_for_node(node_id)]
    if not any(key.startswith(p) for p in allowed):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail=f"node {node_id} holds no live lease covering {key!r}",
        )
```

Call it first in `put_artifact` (`modea.py:503`), after `_safe_key`:

```python
    @router.put("/artifacts/{key:path}")
    async def put_artifact(key: str, request: Request):
        key = _safe_key(key)
        _authorize_write(state, manager, request, key)
        data = await request.body()
        ...
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_service_write_scope.py tests/test_service_modea.py -v`
Expected: 8 new passed; `test_service_modea.py` unchanged and green (it configures no tokens, so the open path is untouched).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add flashruntime/service/modea.py tests/test_service_write_scope.py
git commit -m "feat(service): scope artifact writes to the caller's live leases

Closes HANDOFF.md risk #2 for artifacts: PUT accepted any key from any
caller, and the sha256 check was no defense because the attacker supplied
both file and hash. 401 for an unknown caller, 403 for an out-of-scope key.
Open when no authenticator is configured, so the self-hosted profile is
unchanged. The prefix carries a trailing slash so a sibling task id cannot
satisfy it."
```

### Task 4: Scope checkpoint writes, and fail closed on request

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/checkpoints.py` (`register_part` :47, `commit` :52)
- Modify: `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/app.py` (startup guard)
- Test: extend `flashruntime/tests/test_service_write_scope.py`; `flashruntime/tests/test_service_auth_startup.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_authorize_write` (Task 3). Export it from `modea.py` so `checkpoints.py` can import it — the checkpoint router already receives what it needs at build time; thread `state` and `manager` through `build_router` if they are not already available.

Checkpoint routes carry `job_id` and `task_id` in the path, so authorize `(job_id, task_id)` membership directly rather than by key prefix.

`FLASHML_REQUIRE_NODE_AUTH=1` makes `create_app()` raise at startup when the authenticator is not enforcing. An operator who exposes the coordinator and forgets `FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS` gets a refusal to boot, not a silent open door.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```python
# append to flashruntime/tests/test_service_write_scope.py

def test_checkpoint_part_outside_a_live_lease_is_403(client):
    _register(client, "node-a")

    job_id = _submit_one_task_job(client)
    lease = client.post("/v1alpha1/leases/claim", json={"node_id": "node-a"}).json()
    task_id = lease["payload"]["task_id"]
    key = f"jobs/{job_id}/{task_id}/ckpt/step-10.json"
    client.put(f"/v1alpha1/artifacts/{key}", content=b"{}",
               headers={"Authorization": "Bearer tok-a"})
    r = client.post(

        json={"step": 10, "key": key, "sha256": "0" * 64, "size_bytes": 2},
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer tok-a"},
    )
    assert r.status_code in (200, 201)
```

```python

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_service_write_scope.py tests/test_service_auth_startup.py -v`
Expected: the three checkpoint tests and `test_require_node_auth_without_tokens_refuses_to_start` FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add a lease-pair authorizer beside `_authorize_write` in `modea.py` and export both:

```python
def authorize_task_write(state, manager, request: Request, job_id: str, task_id: str) -> None:
    """Checkpoint routes name (job, task) in the path, so authorize the pair
    directly instead of reconstructing a key prefix."""
    if not state.authenticator.enforcing:
        return
    node_id = state.authenticator.authenticate(_bearer(request))
    if node_id is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="invalid or missing node token")
    if (job_id, task_id) not in manager.live_leases_for_node(node_id):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail=f"node {node_id} holds no live lease on {job_id}/{task_id}",
        )
```

Call it at the top of `register_part` and `commit` in `checkpoints.py`. Those handlers need `state`, `manager`, and the `Request`; thread them in via `build_router(catalog, state=..., manager=...)` and add `request: Request` to each signature, following how `modea.build_router` already receives its state.

In `app.py`'s `create_app`, after the state is built:

```python
    if os.environ.get("FLASHML_REQUIRE_NODE_AUTH") == "1" and not state.authenticator.enforcing:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "FLASHML_REQUIRE_NODE_AUTH=1 but no node tokens are configured — "
            "set FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS. Refusing to start an internet-exposed "
            "coordinator with unauthenticated writes."
        )
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_service_write_scope.py tests/test_service_auth_startup.py tests/test_service_checkpoints.py -v`
Expected: all new passed; `test_service_checkpoints.py` unchanged and green.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add flashruntime/service/checkpoints.py flashruntime/service/modea.py \
        flashruntime/service/app.py tests/test_service_write_scope.py \
        tests/test_service_auth_startup.py
git commit -m "feat(service): scope checkpoint writes; fail closed on request

Checkpoint parts/commit now require a live lease on the (job, task) named in
the path. FLASHML_REQUIRE_NODE_AUTH=1 refuses to boot when no tokens are
configured, so exposing the coordinator and forgetting to set them is a
startup failure rather than a silent open door."
```

### Task 4b: Close the bypasses the Task 3 review found

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/auth.py`
- Modify: `flashruntime/flashruntime/service/modea.py`
- Test: extend `flashruntime/tests/test_service_write_scope.py`, `flashruntime/tests/test_service_auth.py`

**Why this task exists.** The adversarial review of Task 3 found that scoping
*writes* alone does not close the hole. Three of its four findings are
load-bearing, and the third means the plan as originally scoped was
insufficient. All four are verified.

**4b-1 (Critical) — TOCTOU: authorization runs before the body is read.**
`modea.py:554` authorizes, `:555` awaits `request.body()`, `:563` writes. A node
claims a task, opens a chunked `PUT`, and trickles bytes. The sweeper expires the
lease, the task requeues, another node completes and commits — then the original
body lands and overwrites the committed result. **The window is attacker-controlled
(slow body), not bounded by the lease duration, and it defeats revocation
entirely.**
Fix: call `_authorize_write` **again** after `data = await request.body()`, before
writing. `live_leases_for_node` already stops covering a completed or reclaimed
task, so the re-check closes it. Keep the first check too — it rejects
unauthorized callers before buffering a large body.

**4b-2 (Important) — a non-ASCII bearer token is an unauthenticated remote 500.**
`hmac.compare_digest` raises `TypeError` on non-ASCII `str` (verified). That is a
500 instead of a 401, and the difference is an oracle distinguishing "malformed
token" from "wrong token".
Fix: in `StaticTokenAuthenticator.authenticate`, return `None` when
`not token.isascii()`. Test that a non-ASCII token yields 401, not 500.

**4b-3 (Important) — the lease lifecycle endpoints are unauthenticated, which
bypasses everything above.** `claim` (`modea.py:450`) takes `node_id` from the
**request body**; `attempt_complete` (`:482`) and `attempt_fail` (`:518`) take a
`lease_id` and check nothing. An attacker repeatedly fails another node's attempt
until the task requeues to himself, then writes his poison *legitimately* — write
scoping is bypassed one layer down. Note this also violates the spec's own rule
(§5.2): "the API resolves `node_id` **from the token**, never from the request
body."
Fix, when enforcing:
- `claim`: resolve `node_id` from the token and **overwrite** `req.node_id` rather
  than validating it. A mismatch is not an error to report; the body value is
  simply not authoritative.
- `attempt_complete` / `attempt_fail`: 403 unless the lease named by `lease_id`
  is currently held by the authenticated node. `manager.lease_info(lease_id)`
  returns the `Lease`, which carries `node_id`.
- `nodes/register`: resolve the registering `node_id` from the token too, so a
  node cannot register under another's identity.

**4b-4 (Important) — enforcing mode breaks the drivers.**
`flashml_workloads/fedavg_driver.py` PUTs `jobs/{job}/round-NNN/weights.json` and
`kmeans_driver.py` PUTs shard CSVs. **Neither holds a lease**, so both get 403 the
moment tokens are configured — federated averaging and K-means become unrunnable
in exactly the deployment this plan exists to enable.

This is a real gap in the original design: a driver is a legitimate writer that
holds no lease. It runs inside the trusted cloud API (spec §5.4.5), not on a
volunteer machine, so it needs a different credential class — not an exemption.

Fix: add `FLASHML_OPERATOR_TOKENS` (same `name:token` format). An operator token
authenticates and is attributable, but is **not** lease-scoped. Volunteers never
receive one. `NodeAuthenticator` gains `is_operator(token) -> bool`; the two
authorize helpers allow when it returns True. Test that an operator token may
write `jobs/{job}/round-000/weights.json` while a node token may not.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Add to `tests/test_service_write_scope.py`: a non-ASCII token yields 401 not 500;
`node-b` cannot `complete` or `fail` a lease held by `node-a`; `claim` ignores a
body `node_id` that disagrees with the token; an operator token may write the
round-weights key that a node token cannot. Add to `tests/test_service_auth.py`:
`is_operator` is True only for configured operator tokens, and operator tokens
are rejected at construction if they collide with a node token.

The TOCTOU re-check needs a test that does not depend on real streaming: assert
`_authorize_write` is called twice per `put_artifact` (monkeypatch a counter), and
separately that a write is refused when the lease is expired *between* the two
calls (patch `live_leases_for_node` to return the scope on the first call and an
empty set on the second).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify they fail; Step 3: implement; Step 4: verify**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_service_write_scope.py tests/test_service_auth.py tests/test_service_modea.py -v`

Then the whole repo, plus **the fedavg demo with tokens configured** — that is the
regression this task exists to prevent:

```
PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q --ignore=tests/test_examples_e2e.py --ignore=tests/test_gpu_e2e.py
FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS=node-a:tok-a FLASHML_OPERATOR_TOKENS=driver:op-tok \
  PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/python -u scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py
```

The demo must still converge `0.5361 → 0.1757` and exit 0 with enforcement on.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add flashruntime/service/auth.py flashruntime/service/modea.py \
        tests/test_service_write_scope.py tests/test_service_auth.py
git commit -m "fix(service): close the bypasses around lease-scoped writes

Scoping writes alone did not close the hole. The lease lifecycle endpoints
were unauthenticated, so an attacker could fail another node's attempt until
the task requeued to himself and then write legitimately. Authorization also
ran before the request body was read, giving a slow upload an
attacker-controlled window past its own lease expiry. A non-ASCII bearer
token was an unauthenticated remote 500 and a 500-vs-401 oracle. And
enforcing mode made the drivers unrunnable, since a driver is a legitimate
writer that holds no lease — it now uses an operator credential rather than
an exemption."
```

### Task 5: flashnode sends a credential

**Files:**
- Create: `flashnode/flashnode/identity/credentials.py`
- Modify: `flashnode/flashnode/executor/client.py` (`CoordinatorClient.__init__` :29)
- Modify: `flashnode/flashnode/agent/cli.py`
- Test: `flashnode/tests/test_credentials.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `credentials_path() -> Path` — `$FLASHNODE_CREDENTIALS` or `~/.flashnode/credentials.json`
  - `save_token(coordinator: str, token: str) -> Path` — writes 0600
  - `load_token(coordinator: str) -> str | None`
  - `clear_token(coordinator: str) -> bool`
  - `flashnode login --coordinator URL --token TOKEN`, `flashnode logout --coordinator URL`
  - `CoordinatorClient(base_url, ..., token: str | None = None)` sending `Authorization: Bearer`

Tokens are keyed by coordinator URL so one machine can join more than one pool without them overwriting each other.

Note: this is the *manual-token* half. The interactive device flow (`flashnode login` with a browser code) needs a server to talk to and arrives with Plan 3; the credential store and header plumbing built here are what it will reuse.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd flashnode && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_credentials.py -v`
Expected: FAIL — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flashnode.identity.credentials'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `flashnode/flashnode/identity/credentials.py` implementing the five functions above. Requirements the tests pin: JSON object keyed by normalized coordinator URL (strip trailing `/`); create the parent directory; `os.chmod(path, 0o600)` after writing; return `None` rather than raising on unparseable JSON — an agent must not die because a credentials file got truncated.

Then in `CoordinatorClient` (`flashnode/flashnode/executor/client.py:29`): accept `token: str | None = None`, add a `_headers()` method returning `{"Authorization": f"Bearer {self._token}"}` when set and `{}` otherwise, and merge it into every request the class makes. Read the class first — every existing call site must keep working unchanged.

In `flashnode/flashnode/agent/cli.py`: add `login` and `logout` subcommands alongside the existing `work`, and make `work` load a token for its `--coordinator` URL and pass it to `CoordinatorClient`. Print where the credential was written; **never print the token itself**.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cd flashnode && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q`
Expected: 10 new passed on top of the 75-passed baseline; nothing regressed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add flashnode/identity/credentials.py flashnode/executor/client.py \
        flashnode/agent/cli.py tests/test_credentials.py
git commit -m "feat(identity): per-coordinator credential store and bearer auth

Tokens are keyed by coordinator URL so one machine can join several pools
without clobbering. File is 0600; a corrupt file yields no token rather than
killing the agent. This is the manual-token half — the interactive device
flow needs a server and arrives with the cloud API, reusing this store."

### Task 6: Prove the exploit is closed end to end

**Files:**
- Create: `../e2e/test_write_scope.py` (workspace repo)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above. Uses the `coordinator` fixture in `e2e/conftest.py`.

Unit tests use `TestClient`. This proves it against a real coordinator process with real agents, which is the configuration that will actually be deployed.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

The `coordinator` fixture must start with `FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS` set — read `e2e/conftest.py` and add a parametrized or sibling fixture rather than changing the existing one, so the current e2e tests keep their open profile.

Assert, over real HTTP:
1. A write with no token → 401.
2. `node-b` writing under a task `node-a` holds → **403**. This is the exploit: one volunteer overwriting another's committed result.
3. `node-a` writing under its own held task → 200.
4. After `node-a`'s lease expires, the same write → 403.
5. A write to `jobs/{job}/round-000/weights.json` (the federated-averaging model key, outside any task prefix) → 403 for every node.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and iterate**

Run: `cd /Users/phongcao/Work/Zolli-Labs && PATH="$PWD/e2e/.venv/bin:$PATH" e2e/.venv/bin/pytest e2e/test_write_scope.py -v`

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm nothing regressed anywhere**

```
cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q --ignore=tests/test_examples_e2e.py --ignore=tests/test_gpu_e2e.py
cd ../flashnode   && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q
cd ..             && PATH="$PWD/e2e/.venv/bin:$PATH" e2e/.venv/bin/pytest e2e/ -q
cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/python -u scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py
```

Expected: 417+ / 75+ / 7+ and the demo still converging `0.5361 → 0.1757` at exit 0. **The demo runs the open profile** — if it broke, the default path is no longer backward compatible, which is a Task 3 defect, not a demo problem.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd .. && git add e2e/test_write_scope.py
git commit -m "test(e2e): one volunteer cannot overwrite another's results"
```

### Task 7: Documentation and the progress entry

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashruntime/docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md` — it currently documents "one shared join code" as a known gap; update to per-machine tokens and revocation.
- Modify: `flashruntime/docs/site/guides/federated-averaging.md` — the round-weights key is now write-protected.
- Modify: `../PROGRESS.md` — entry per the logging protocol; tick Plan 2 in the M1 checklist.
- Modify: `../M1_DECISIONS.md` — close the D11 note that deferred these two items to Plan 2.

State honestly what is still **not** true: the tokens here are configured statically on the coordinator; self-service enrolment arrives with the cloud API. Result verification (a node lying about its own result) remains M3 and is untouched by this plan.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the docs and the entry, then commit**

```bash
cd .. && git add PROGRESS.md M1_DECISIONS.md
git -C flashruntime add docs/
git commit -m "docs(progress): agent identity + lease-scoped writes (M1 Plan 2 of 7)"
```

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage.** §5.2 (agent credential, bearer token) → Tasks 1, 5. §6.1 (lease-scoped artifact and checkpoint writes) → Tasks 3, 4, 6. §6.2 (shared join code replaced) → Tasks 1, 5, 7. The §5.2 *device flow* is deliberately **not** here: it needs a server, so it belongs with the cloud API in Plan 3 — Task 5 builds the credential store and header plumbing it will reuse. `resolve node_id from the token, never the body` (spec §5.2) is satisfied because `_authorize_write` derives `node_id` from the token alone and never reads the request body.

**Not covered, deliberately:** read-side authorization (Plan 3, by job ownership); result verification (M3); the abandoned-shard zombie tasks from Plan 1's review (needs cooperative cancel, M3).

**Type consistency.** `authenticate(token: str | None) -> str | None` is used identically in Tasks 1, 3, 4. `live_leases_for_node(node_id) -> set[tuple[str, str]]` is defined in Task 2 and consumed as a set of `(job_id, task_id)` pairs in Tasks 3 and 4. `enforcing` is a property on every authenticator and is read in Tasks 3, 4. `_bearer(request)` is defined once in Task 3 and reused in Task 4.

**Known risk to watch during execution.** Task 4 threads `state` and `manager` into `checkpoints.build_router`, changing its signature. Check every call site — `service/app.py` at minimum — and note that `tests/test_service_checkpoints.py` may construct the router directly.
