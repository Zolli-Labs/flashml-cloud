# Federated-Averaging Driver Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Train one model across several independent leased tasks by exchanging weight deltas once per round instead of gradients once per step, so volunteer machines on home internet can jointly train a model.

**Architecture:** A driver submits one Mode A job per round; each task loads the round's weights, trains locally for K steps on its shard, and writes a weight delta. The driver reduces the deltas into new weights and submits the next round. This is `flashml_workloads/kmeans_driver.py`'s control flow with `reduce` replaced — "pipelines are jobs chained by a driver, not a new execution mode." Unlike K-means, the driver aggregates on a **quorum** rather than requiring every shard, so a slow machine degrades participation instead of stalling the round.

**Tech Stack:** Python ≥3.10, pydantic, pure-stdlib workload modules, FastAPI service (existing), pytest.

This plan implements §5.4 of `flashml-cloud/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-deployed-multi-user-poc-design.md`. It is Plan 1 of 7 for M1.

## Global Constraints

- **Pure stdlib in the driver and the reduce path.** `flashml_workloads/kmeans_shard.py` and `sgd_trainer.py` are both pure stdlib ("runs anywhere, including `--network none` containers"). The driver must import no torch — it runs inside `flashml-api` (spec §5.4.5), which must not carry a torch dependency. Only `fedavg_worker.py` imports torch, and only inside functions.
- **Weights are JSON**, not `torch.save`: `{"<param name>": {"shape": [int, ...], "data": [float, ...]}}`. This keeps the driver torch-free. For the M1 demo model (~100k params) this is ~2 MB per delta per round, which home links handle in seconds. Binary encoding is an M2 optimization; do not add it here.
- **Determinism is the contract.** Per `sgd_trainer.py`: "resuming from step k reproduces the uninterrupted run bit-for-bit — recovery must never silently change the result." Seed every RNG from `spec["params"]["seed"]`.
- **`metrics.json` is the commit artifact.** Per the 2026-07-29 fix, only a root-level `metrics.json` sets the commit hash; the executor uploads `/work/out/` recursively. The delta goes to `/work/out/delta.json`, and `metrics.json` references it.
- **New task modules must be added to `ALLOWED_TASK_MODULES`** (`flashruntime/service/modea.py:51`) or expansion fails closed.
- **Existing suites must stay green.** Measured baseline on this machine
  (2026-07-31, before this plan): **319 passed** on the fast subset.
- **Run tests with the venv on `PATH`, not just the venv's pytest:**

      cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest

  Invoking `.venv/bin/pytest` alone makes
  `test_examples_e2e.py::test_sklearn_sweep_end_to_end` fail with
  `LaunchError: failed to start 'python'` — `LocalLauncher` spawns
  `argv[0] = "python"`, which is not resolvable unless the venv is on `PATH`.
  The same cause skips three torchrun tests. That failure is environmental;
  do not chase it.
- **Inner loop** (the full suite's torchrun DDP tests take many minutes):

      PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q \
        --ignore=tests/test_examples_e2e.py --ignore=tests/test_gpu_e2e.py

  → 319 passed in ~10 s at baseline. Run the full suite once, at Task 6.
- Never run the coordinator with more than one uvicorn worker (`HANDOFF.md` risk #5).

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `flashml_workloads/fedavg_weights.py` (new) | Weight/delta JSON encoding + the pure reduce function. No torch, no I/O. The only file both the worker and driver import. |
| `flashml_workloads/fedavg_worker.py` (new) | The leased task: load weights, train K local steps, emit delta. Imports torch inside functions only. |
| `flashml_workloads/fedavg_driver.py` (new) | The round loop: submit job, await quorum, reduce, repeat. Pure stdlib. |
| `flashruntime/service/modea.py` (modify) | `_expand_fedavg` + `federated_averaging` workload type + allowlist entry. |
| `tests/test_fedavg_weights.py` (new) | Reduce arithmetic, encoding round-trip, quorum/late-delta rules. |
| `tests/test_fedavg_worker.py` (new) | Task module contract: spec in, delta + metrics out. |
| `tests/test_fedavg_driver.py` (new) | Round loop against a fake coordinator: quorum, deadline, resume. |
| `tests/test_service_fedavg.py` (new) | `_expand_fedavg` produces correct TaskSpecs. |

Splitting `fedavg_weights.py` out of the driver is the decomposition decision that matters: the reduce is the part with real arithmetic to get wrong, and isolating it means it is tested without a coordinator, a job, or torch.

### Task 1: Weight encoding and the reduce function

**Files:**
- Create: `flashml_workloads/fedavg_weights.py`
- Test: `tests/test_fedavg_weights.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces:
  - `encode(state: dict[str, tuple[list[int], list[float]]]) -> dict` — name → `{"shape", "data"}`
  - `decode(blob: dict) -> dict[str, tuple[list[int], list[float]]]`
  - `subtract(new: dict, base: dict) -> dict` — element-wise delta, same JSON shape
  - `apply_delta(base: dict, delta: dict, scale: float = 1.0) -> dict`
  - `reduce_deltas(contributions: list[tuple[dict, int]]) -> dict` — weighted mean of deltas by sample count
  - `WeightShapeMismatch(ValueError)`

### Task 2: The worker task module

**Files:**
- Create: `flashml_workloads/fedavg_worker.py`
- Test: `tests/test_fedavg_worker.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fedavg_weights.encode/decode/subtract` (Task 1).
- Produces:
  - CLI `python -m flashml_workloads.fedavg_worker --spec spec.json --out OUTDIR`
  - `build_model(seed: int, in_dim: int, hidden: int, out_dim: int)` — returns a torch module
  - `state_to_blob(model) -> dict` / `blob_to_state(model, blob) -> None`
  - `run_worker(spec: dict, outdir: Path) -> dict` — writes `delta.json` + returns the metrics dict
- Writes `OUTDIR/delta.json` and `OUTDIR/metrics.json`. `metrics.json` carries `{"round", "shard", "samples", "loss", "local_steps", "delta_file": "delta.json"}`.

`spec.json` shape (mirrors `kmeans_shard`'s contract):

```python

"""One federated-averaging round on one shard, runnable as a leased task.

Executor contract (same as kmeans_shard / sgd_trainer):

    params: round, shard, num_shards, local_steps, lr, batch_size, seed,
            in_dim, hidden, out_dim, dataset_size
    inputs: weights (optional path to the round's weights JSON; absent on

Outputs `OUTDIR/delta.json` (this worker's weight change) and
`OUTDIR/metrics.json` (the commit artifact — only a root-level
metrics.json sets the commit hash).

Why a delta and not the new weights: the driver averages contributions,
and averaging deltas keeps the arithmetic correct when a worker joins a
round late with stale weights — its delta is still a valid direction from
the weights it actually saw.

### Task 3: Job expansion for the `federated_averaging` workload type

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashruntime/service/modea.py:51-55` (allowlist), and add `_expand_fedavg` beside `_expand_kmeans` (`modea.py:142`)
- Test: `tests/test_service_fedavg.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `flashml_workloads.fedavg_worker` (Task 2) by module name only.
- Produces: `_expand_fedavg(job_id: str, spec: JobSpec) -> list[TaskSpec]`. Task ids are `shard-000`…; `commit_key` is `jobs/{job_id}/{task_id}/metrics.json`.

Workload parameters: `round`, `num_shards`, `weights` (an `artifact://` URI, absent on round 0), plus the worker params passed through (`local_steps`, `lr`, `batch_size`, `seed`, `in_dim`, `hidden`, `out_dim`, `dataset_size`), and `lease_seconds`.

### Task 4: Driver round loop with quorum

**Files:**
- Create: `flashml_workloads/fedavg_driver.py`
- Test: `tests/test_fedavg_driver.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fedavg_weights.reduce_deltas/apply_delta/encode` (Task 1); the `federated_averaging` workload type (Task 3).
- Produces:
  - `run_fedavg(coord: Coordinator, *, rounds, num_shards, min_participants, worker_params, initial_weights, round_timeout_s=600.0, poll_seconds=1.0, lease_seconds=120.0, on_round=None) -> dict`
    returning `{"weights": blob, "history": [RoundResult, ...], "job_ids": [str, ...]}`.
    It takes a `Coordinator`, **not** a base URL — the HTTP adapter that turns a
    URL into one is Task 5, which is also what lets the cloud API inject auth
    headers without the driver knowing about auth. `initial_weights` is required
    and must already be encoded (`fedavg_weights.encode` is the caller's job,
    not the driver's).
  - `RoundResult` TypedDict: `{"round": int, "participants": int, "mean_loss": float, "job_id": str}`
  - `QuorumNotMet(RuntimeError)`

Quorum semantics, exactly:
- The driver polls the round's job. Once **`min_participants`** shard tasks have committed, it aggregates immediately and does **not** wait for the rest.
- Deltas that commit after aggregation are discarded — never applied to a later round (they were computed from weights that no longer exist).
- If the round deadline passes with fewer than `min_participants` commits, raise `QuorumNotMet`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

"""Federated averaging as a sequence of lease jobs.

One round = one Mode A job (N independent shard tasks); the driver reduces
the shard deltas into new weights and submits the next round. Same
stage-composition pattern as `kmeans_driver` — "pipelines are jobs chained
by a driver, not a new execution mode" — so a dead worker costs one shard
retry and a dead driver resumes from the last completed round.

The one deliberate difference from kmeans_driver: it required *every*
shard (`if len(partials) != len(shard_uris): raise`). This driver
aggregates on a QUORUM. Volunteer machines are unequal and unreliable by
definition; requiring all of them would let one closed laptop stall every
participant's round. Deltas arriving after aggregation are DISCARDED, never
carried into a later round — they were computed against weights that no
longer exist, and applying them would silently corrupt the average.

Pure stdlib: this runs inside the cloud API, which must not carry torch.

### Task 5: HTTP coordinator adapter and driver resume

**Files:**
- Modify: `flashml_workloads/fedavg_driver.py`
- Test: `tests/test_fedavg_driver.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Coordinator` protocol (Task 4).
- Produces:
  - `HttpCoordinator(base_url: str, headers: dict[str, str] | None = None)` implementing `Coordinator`
  - `resume_state(coord: Coordinator, job_ids: list[str]) -> tuple[int, dict, str | None]` returning `(next_round, weights, weights_uri)`
  - `run_fedavg(..., start_round: int = 0)` — resumes rather than restarting

HttpCoordinator takes caller-supplied headers so the cloud API injects
credentials without the driver knowing about auth. resume_state finds the
newest committed round-weights artifact; rounds are idempotent because
weights are written only after aggregation."

### Task 6: Local two-agent convergence demo

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py`
- Create: `scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py`
- Create: `docs/site/guides/federated-averaging.md` (register it if `scripts/build_docs.py --check` requires an index entry)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above.
- Produces: `run_round_worker(base_url, node_id)` — a minimal in-test agent that claims one lease, executes it, uploads, and commits. Returns `True` if it did work, `False` if the queue was empty.

This is the task that proves the premise. Everything before it is unit-tested arithmetic.

> **Repo-boundary correction (why this is not `tests/integration/` with real
> `flashnode work` agents).** `flashruntime/CLAUDE.md` hard rule #1: "this repo
> imports NOTHING from `flashnode` or `flashml-cloud`. Ever." The workspace
> `e2e/` suite is where cross-repo proofs live — `e2e/test_local_loop.py`
> imports `flashnode.executor` precisely because it sits outside both repos.
> An integration test inside flashruntime that spawned `flashnode work` would
> make flashruntime's suite unrunnable without flashnode installed.
>
> So this task proves convergence **inside flashruntime** using a small
> in-test agent that speaks the coordinator's HTTP API directly — no flashnode
> import, no Docker. Task 6b then proves the same loop with genuine
> `ExecutorLoop` agents in the workspace `e2e/` suite, which is allowed to
> import both.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py
"""Federated averaging against a REAL coordinator over real HTTP.

The unit tests pin the arithmetic against a fake; this pins the whole loop:
real job expansion, real leases, real artifact storage, real commit-time
sha256 validation. The "agent" here is a few lines of urllib rather than
flashnode — flashruntime must not depend on flashnode (CLAUDE.md rule #1),
and the point being proven is the ROUND loop, not the sandbox.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py -v`
Expected: FAIL — the coordinator rejects `federated_averaging` or the driver cannot import, depending on what is missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Make it pass, then write the demo script and guide**

**Placement preconditions — verified before this task was written, so do not
re-derive them if a task never gets leased:**

- `IsolationSpec.tier` defaults to `"standard"` (`protocol/v1alpha1.py:97`), and
  `IsolationAwarePlacement` lets `"standard"` "run anywhere". The test agent
  registering with `sandbox_capable: False` is therefore eligible. Do NOT set
  `isolation.tier: "sandboxed"` in the round JobSpec — that would fail closed
  against this agent and the job would sit PENDING until the round deadline.
- The `module_capable` gate is fail-OPEN (`is False` excludes; absent counts as
  capable), so registering it `True` is belt-and-braces, not required.
- `argv_capable` is irrelevant here: these are `module` payloads, not `argv`.

If a lease never arrives, check the coordinator's `/v1alpha1/jobs/{id}` state
and events first — a silent 204 from `/leases/claim` means either the queue is
empty or nothing is eligible for this node, and the endpoint does not
distinguish them (a known gap recorded in the 2026-07-29 deferred list).

Debug against the real coordinator until both tests pass. Expect to iterate
here — this is the first time the pieces meet. Known traps:

1. **cwd must be the flashruntime repo root**, never the workspace root: from
   there `flashruntime/` resolves as a namespace package and imports fail
   confusingly (`HANDOFF.md` §3).
2. **`python -u`** or the coordinator's output buffers and it looks hung.
3. The coordinator hosts artifacts only when `FLASHML_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR` is
   set — without it the PUT/GET round trip fails.
4. `PUT /v1alpha1/artifacts/{key}` and the commit `output_sha256` must agree
   byte-for-byte; the coordinator re-hashes and a mismatch fails the attempt
   rather than committing.

`scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py` runs the same loop as a human-watchable demo and
prints one line per round:

```
round 0  participants 2/2  mean_loss 0.7031
round 1  participants 2/2  mean_loss 0.6402
...
converged: 0.7031 -> 0.4118 over 4 rounds
```

It must exit non-zero if the final loss is not below the first — a demo that
prints numbers nobody checks is not evidence.

`docs/site/guides/federated-averaging.md` covers: why rounds and not DDP (the
`--network none` rendezvous constraint), the quorum rule and why late deltas
are discarded, the `flashml.yaml` shape, and an explicit statement that this
proves collaborative training rather than *faster* training (spec §10).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the demo and the tests**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/python -u scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py`
Expected: 4 rounds print, final loss below the first, exit 0

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py -v`
Expected: 2 passed

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the full suite and docs check**

Run: `cd flashruntime && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/pytest -q && PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" .venv/bin/python scripts/build_docs.py --check && ./scripts/audit_secrets.sh`
Expected: ≥319 pre-existing passed plus the ~40 added by this plan; docs check OK; secrets CLEAN

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py \
        docs/site/guides/federated-averaging.md
git commit -m "feat(fedavg): convergence proven against a real coordinator

Two independent workers jointly reduce one model's loss over real HTTP:
real expansion, real leases, real artifact storage, real commit-time sha256
validation. A round still aggregates when a third shard never reports.

The agent here is a few lines of urllib, not flashnode: CLAUDE.md rule #1
forbids this repo depending on flashnode. Task 6b proves the same loop with
genuine ExecutorLoop agents in the workspace e2e/ suite."
```

---

### Task 6b: The same loop with genuine agents (workspace `e2e/`)

**Files:**
- Create: `../e2e/test_fedavg_loop.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `coordinator` fixture already in `../e2e/conftest.py`.

Task 6 proves the round loop inside flashruntime with a hand-rolled agent.
This proves it with the real one. `e2e/` is the only place allowed to import
both repos — `e2e/test_local_loop.py` already does
`from flashnode.executor import CoordinatorClient, ExecutorLoop, SubprocessRunner`
and drives agents as threads against the `coordinator` fixture. Follow that
file's structure exactly.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Model it on `e2e/test_local_loop.py`: build two `ExecutorLoop` instances with
`SubprocessRunner`, run each in a thread against the `coordinator` fixture,
and drive `run_fedavg` from the main thread. Assert:
- 3 rounds complete with 2 participants each and decreasing mean loss;
- when one loop is stopped after round 1, the remaining rounds still complete
  with `participants == 1` and `min_participants=1` — the closed-laptop case.

Reuse `WORKER_PARAMS` and `_initial_weights` from Task 6 by importing them, or
duplicate them locally if the import crosses an awkward boundary; do not
invent different values, or the two tests stop being comparable.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and iterate**

Run: `cd .. && make e2e` (or `PATH=... pytest e2e/test_fedavg_loop.py -v` from
the workspace root — check `e2e/README.md` for the invocation this workspace
uses).

Note `SubprocessRunner` executes `python -m flashml_workloads.fedavg_worker`,
so the agents' environment needs torch importable. If the e2e venv lacks
torch, either install it there or mark this test to skip with a clear reason —
**skipping silently is not acceptable**; the skip message must say torch is
missing so nobody reads a skip as a pass.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd .. && git add e2e/test_fedavg_loop.py
git commit -m "test(e2e): federated averaging across two genuine flashnode agents"
```

---

### Task 7: Log the slice in PROGRESS.md

**Files:**
- Modify: `../PROGRESS.md` (workspace root)

Required by the workspace logging protocol: "Evidence or it didn't happen."

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the entry**

Newest-first under `## Entries`, following the template. It must carry: real
test counts per suite, the demo command run and its actual output (the loss
numbers), and — per rule 4 — the reasoning behind the quorum decision so nobody
"harmonizes" it back to kmeans_driver's all-shards rule later.

State honestly what is **not** proven: no real Docker daemon run, no
cross-internet run, no heterogeneous hardware. Those arrive in Plans 6 and 7.

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd .. && git add PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "docs(progress): federated-averaging driver (fedavg slice, Plan 1 of M1)"
```

---

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage.** §5.4.1 (why rounds not DDP) → Task 6 guide. §5.4.2 (reuse the
driver pattern) → Tasks 3–4. §5.4.3 (round quorum) → Task 4. §5.4.4 (data
placement) → Task 2 `_make_shard`; the baked-in-image variant belongs to Plan 7,
which builds the curated images. §5.4.5 (driver runs in flashml-api) → Task 5's
`Coordinator` protocol and header injection, which is the seam Plan 3 consumes.
§5.4 repo boundary (driver lives in flashruntime) → the whole plan is in
flashruntime. §7 error rows for round quorum → Tasks 4–5. §8 FedAvg test rows →
Tasks 1, 4, 5.

**Deliberately not covered here:** the `flashml.yaml` → `federated_averaging`
compilation (Plan 4), and the MNIST-vs-CIFAR baked dataset (Plan 7, open
question §11.3). Task 2 uses synthetic data so this plan has no dataset
dependency at all.

**Type consistency.** `reduce_deltas(list[tuple[dict, int]])` is called in Task 4
as `reduce_deltas([(d, n) for d, n, _ in collected])` — matches. `apply_delta(base,
delta, scale=1.0)` called as `apply_delta(weights, reduced)` — matches the
default. `state_to_blob`/`blob_to_state` used consistently in Task 2. `Coordinator`
protocol methods (`submit`, `job_state`, `artifacts`, `get_artifact`,
`put_artifact`) match `FakeCoordinator` and `HttpCoordinator` exactly.
`metrics["delta_file"]` written in Task 2, read in Task 4's `_collect`.

**Known rough edge:** `resume_state` in Task 5 has a redundant no-op loop over
`coord.artifacts(job_id)` and a nested scan that is more complex than the
problem needs. Its tests pin the behavior; simplify it during implementation if
the tests stay green.
