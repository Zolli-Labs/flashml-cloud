# Federated averaging

Federated averaging (FedAvg) is FlashRuntime's answer to a question the
[PyTorch guide](pytorch.md) and the
[JobSpec & isolation guide](jobspec-and-isolation.md) both run into: what do
you do when the machines that want to help train a model **cannot talk to
each other**? Volunteer nodes run their task containers with `--network
none` (see the repo's `docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md`) — no LAN, no
internet, no way for one container to find another. Coordinated
multi-process training (DDP, FSDP) needs the opposite: every rank must
rendezvous with every other rank over a process group before the first
`all_reduce`. On a volunteer pool those two requirements are irreconcilable,
so FlashRuntime does not attempt coordinated training there at all.

FedAvg sidesteps the rendezvous problem by never requiring it. Instead of
ranks synchronizing gradients mid-step, **rounds** synchronize whole models
between steps:

1. The driver broadcasts the current weights as a plain `artifact://` blob.
2. Each participating node downloads the weights, trains **independently**
   for a fixed number of local steps on its own data shard, and uploads a
   weight **delta** (not the new weights — see below).
3. Once enough deltas have committed, the driver averages them, applies the
   result to the broadcast weights, and starts the next round.

No node ever needs to see another node's IP address, let alone open a
connection to it. Every cross-node interaction is a `PUT`/`GET` against the
coordinator's artifact store, which is exactly the same shape of traffic a
volunteer node already does to pull its task inputs and push its results.
That is why this is a **round loop implemented as a driver chaining
ordinary lease jobs** (`flashml_workloads/fedavg_driver.py`,
`flashml_workloads/fedavg_worker.py`) — the same "pipelines are jobs chained
by a driver, not a new execution mode" pattern as the sharded-k-means POC —
rather than a new backend.

## Why a delta, not the new weights

Each worker's task uploads `delta.json` (the change it made to the weights
it started from) alongside `metrics.json`. The driver averages **deltas**,
not raw weight snapshots, because a delta is a direction that stays
meaningful even if the weights it was computed against are no longer the
newest ones — the exact situation a straggling volunteer produces when it
finally reports in after the round has moved on. Averaging final weights
directly would require every worker to have started from the *same*
snapshot; averaging deltas only requires knowing what each worker started
from, which the driver already does.

## The quorum rule, and why late deltas are discarded

`kmeans_driver` (the other job-chaining driver in this codebase) requires
**every** dispatched shard to report before it aggregates. FedAvg
deliberately does not: `run_fedavg(..., min_participants=N)` aggregates as
soon as `N` of the round's shards have committed, not when all of them have.

This is not a shortcut — it is the correct policy for volunteer compute.
Machines that donate spare cycles are unequal and unreliable by
construction: laptops close, Wi-Fi drops, a slow machine might still be on
local step 3 when a fast one has already finished. Requiring all of them
before a round can proceed would let a single closed laptop stall every
other participant's contribution indefinitely. Quorum aggregation lets the
round move on as soon as it has a statistically meaningful sample.

The corollary is what makes quorum aggregation *safe* rather than merely
convenient: once the driver has read the quorum's deltas and applied them,
**any delta that commits afterward for that round is discarded**, never
folded into a later round. `run_fedavg` freezes the participant set at the
moment quorum is reached and never re-reads that job's artifacts again
(`fedavg_driver.py`, `run_fedavg`). A late delta was computed against
weights that no longer exist by the time it arrives — the model has already
moved past them — and applying it on top of a newer round's weights would
not be "one more contribution," it would silently corrupt the average with
a step that was never actually taken from the current state. Discarding is
the honest behavior; a driver that tried to be more "inclusive" here would
be quietly wrong instead.

`tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py::test_round_completes_on_quorum_when_a_node_never_reports`
pins exactly this: three shards are dispatched but the test's agent pool is
capped to exactly two successful claims and then stops claiming, so the
third shard is never bound to any node and sits PENDING for the life of the
test. The round still aggregates on the two that committed — with an exact
`participants == 2` assertion — rather than hanging until the deadline
waiting for the shard nobody was ever going to serve. (The cap on claims,
not the node count, is what makes the third shard genuinely abandoned:
either registered node can claim either shard, so without the cap both
nodes could sequentially serve all three before the driver's poll notices
quorum.)

## What counts as a participant, and what the driver refuses

Everything a volunteer node produces — the delta, the sample count, the
metrics file, the filenames — is attacker-controlled input. Result
*verification* (catching a node that lies about a delta it honestly
computed) is a later milestone, but input validation and containment are
not deferred:

- **A participant is an accepted commit, not an uploaded file.** The driver
  counts only keys that exactly match the round's dispatched task set
  (`jobs/{job_id}/shard-{i:03d}/metrics.json` for `i < num_shards`), and
  cross-checks them against the tasks the coordinator reports `COMPLETED`
  (`GET /v1alpha1/jobs/{id}/tasks`). Both halves are load-bearing: the agent
  uploads a task's output tree recursively, so a nested `out/a/metrics.json`
  would otherwise mint a second participant from one lease; and uploads
  happen *before* the commit is offered, so an attempt the coordinator
  rejected (lost lease, sha256 mismatch) would otherwise still be averaged
  in.
- **Sample counts must be positive.** Validating only the total is not
  enough — `(delta=-999, n=-999)` plus `(delta=1.0, n=1000)` totals a
  healthy 1 sample but yields a weight of `999001.0` where the honest step
  is `1.0`. A sample-weighted mean is only a convex combination when every
  count is positive.
- **NaN and Inf are rejected, not averaged.** Python's `json` both emits and
  parses `NaN`/`Infinity`, and NaN is absorbing: one non-finite value turns
  every weight NaN, and every later round then trains from NaN while the run
  still reports success. This one needs no attacker — a learning rate that
  diverges on one shard does it. `fedavg_weights` fails closed on any
  non-finite value entering the reduce or leaving `apply_delta`/`subtract`,
  naming the parameter and index.
- **`lease_seconds` is bounded** (`modea.MAX_LEASE_SECONDS`, one hour). A
  lease deadline is the only thing that returns an abandoned task to the
  queue, so `1e9` would pin a shard to a closed laptop for ~31 years and
  `inf` overflows `timedelta` inside the coordinator's claim path.

Artifact `PUT` is now authenticated and lease-scoped when the coordinator
sets `FLASHML_NODE_TOKENS` (the per-machine-token slice): a node token can
only write under `jobs/{job}/{task}/` for a task it currently holds a live
lease on. The round-weights key
(`jobs/{job_id}/round-{round:03d}/weights.json`) belongs to no task and no
node's lease, so a plain node token cannot write it — the driver instead
authenticates with an **operator token** (`FLASHML_OPERATOR_TOKENS`), which
is attributable but deliberately not lease-scoped, exactly because drivers
are legitimate writers outside any lease (see
`docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md`). Result verification is still a separate,
unbuilt concern: this scoping stops an unrelated node from *overwriting* the
round weights, not from a participant lying about the delta it honestly
computed.

## The `flashml.yaml` shape

A federated-averaging round is submitted as an ordinary lease-mode job:

```yaml
apiVersion: flashml.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: fedavg-r000
spec:
  execution:
    backend: leases
  image:
    repository: local/tier1
    tag: dev
  workload:
    type: federated_averaging
    parameters:
      round: 0
      num_shards: 2
      local_steps: 20
      lr: 0.1
      batch_size: 16
      seed: 0
      in_dim: 8
      hidden: 16
      out_dim: 2
      dataset_size: 256
      # weights: artifact://jobs/<prev-job>/round-000/weights.json
      # (omitted on round 0 — each worker seeds its own model from `seed`)
```

`isolation.tier` is left at its default, `"standard"`, deliberately: unlike
the `argv` runner tier for arbitrary bring-your-code jobs, a
`federated_averaging` task's payload is a fixed, trusted `module` execution
(`flashml_workloads.fedavg_worker`), so it does not need the sandboxed argv
path and its `argv_capable` gate. A node only needs `module_capable`
(fail-open — absent counts as capable) to be eligible. `run_fedavg` builds
this JobSpec once per round and submits it as a new job
(`flashml_workloads/fedavg_driver.py:_round_body`) — the round number is
the only thing that changes between the driver's own resume points. The
image and isolation tier are `run_fedavg` parameters
(`image=`, `isolation_tier=`); the defaults above are this repo's e2e
fixture image, which only works because `SubprocessRunner` ignores `image`
entirely — a docker-tier volunteer needs a real, pullable reference.

## What this proves — and what it does not

`tests/test_fedavg_convergence.py` runs this loop against a **real**
coordinator over real HTTP: real job expansion, real leases, real local
artifact storage (`FLASHML_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR`), and real commit-time
sha256 validation on every uploaded artifact. Two independent worker
"agents" (a few lines of `urllib`, standing in for `flashnode work` — see
the test file's docstring for why an in-repo test cannot import `flashnode`
directly) pull leases, train, and commit without ever talking to each
other. The measured per-round mean loss across four rounds with two
participating nodes:

```
round 0  participants 2/2  mean_loss 0.5361
round 1  participants 2/2  mean_loss 0.3781
round 2  participants 2/2  mean_loss 0.2548
round 3  participants 2/2  mean_loss 0.1757
converged: 0.5361 -> 0.1757 over 4 rounds
```

(`scripts/fedavg_local_demo.py` reproduces this and exits non-zero if the
final round's loss is not below the first — a demo that prints numbers
nobody checks is not evidence.)

Read that number correctly: **this proves collaborative training, not
faster training.** Two nodes did not finish training in half the wall-clock
time of one — they trained *sequentially* through four rounds, each doing
its own local steps, and the loss came down because their independently
computed updates were combined. Nothing here claims a throughput or
speed-up result; DDP/FSDP make that claim, on a coordinated pool that can
rendezvous, and that claim is out of scope for volunteer nodes entirely (the
repo's `docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md` has the full list of things the
volunteer pool does not attempt, including "no coordinated multi-process
training"). What FedAvg proves is that machines which cannot see or trust
each other — and
in the volunteer case, cannot even reach each other over the network — can
still jointly move one model's loss in the right direction, coordinated
entirely through the coordinator's leases and artifact store.
