# Scans BOTH the full commit history (`git log -p --all` — every version of
# every tracked file ever committed, on every branch) AND the current tracked
# worktree for credential-shaped strings. Any hit exits 1 so CI or a release
# can block on it.
#
# Coverage: exactly the set that travels on a push — every ref-reachable commit
# (all branches + tags, via --all) plus the tracked worktree. It deliberately does
# NOT scan dangling/unreachable blobs, the stash, reflog-only commits, or binary blob bytes.
#
# `.env` is where real secrets live locally (the RunPod API key). It MUST stay
# untracked and gitignored: this script asserts that loudly and never reads its
# contents. Because the worktree scan uses `git grep` (tracked files only, and
# it honours .gitignore), .env and .venv are excluded automatically.
#
# Patterns (extend as new providers appear):
#   rpa_…                RunPod API key
#   AKIA…                AWS access key id
#   ghp_…                GitHub personal access token
#   -----BEGIN … KEY     PEM private-key header
#   sk-…                 OpenAI-style secret key
#
# Note: the alternation below is written with regex metacharacters ([, {) right
# after each prefix, so this script does not match ITS OWN patterns.
