# AGENTS.md — flashruntime

Context for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) working in this repository.

## What this repo is

The **open-source fault-tolerant distributed ML runtime** of the FlashML
system (Zolli Labs). It owns the public protocol: job specs, task graphs,
leases, heartbeats, checkpoint manifests, failure taxonomy, recovery state
machine, adapters, CLI/SDK. Full product context: `docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`.

Sibling repos (cloned side-by-side under `~/Work/Zolli-Labs/`):
- `../flashnode` — public host agent; depends on this repo.
- `../flashml-cloud` — private managed control plane; depends on this repo.

## Hard rules

1. **Dependency direction:** this repo imports NOTHING from `flashnode` or
   `flashml-cloud`. Ever. They import us.
2. **This repo goes public at launch** (Apache-2.0). No secrets, no keys, no
   private business logic, no references to private-repo internals in code or
   commit history. Secrets only via `.env` (gitignored).
3. **Schemas are versioned.** Any wire-visible message or spec carries a
   schema version. Security-relevant fields fail closed.
4. **The runtime must stay useful without the cloud** — self-hosted local
   coordinator is a first-class mode, not a demo shim.
5. Recovery actions are typed, deterministic, and logged. No LLM-driven
   recovery decisions.
6. **Four orthogonal axes** (ADR-0003): providers get machines, launchers
   start processes, strategies configure execution, recipes integrate user
   code. Hugging Face code lives in `recipes/` — it is workload layer,
   never a backend. The planner emits a backend-neutral `StrategyPlan` and
   **never imports framework code** (no `import transformers`/`torch
   .distributed`/`ray` inside `planner/`).
7. **No empty scaffolding.** Create a module only in the vertical slice
   that makes it real (workspace-root `PLAN_2WEEKS.md`). Mode A (leases)
   before Mode B extensions; never reimplement distributed ML — plan,
   launch, observe, recover. *Amendment (2026-07-19, by user request):*
   future-work packages carry **complete designed interfaces** (ABCs with
   full input/output contracts + contract tests in
   `tests/test_interfaces.py`) instead of docstring stubs — implement
   against them; change a contract only with a red test + a note.
8. Ledger is append-only; job/task status is derived from events, never a
   hand-mutated field. Checkpoint manifests are written last, after part
   hashes verify — no manifest, no checkpoint.

## Current state (July 2026)

- `protocol/v1alpha1.py` = the versioned public protocol (JobSpec, JobState,
  Event vocabulary, ArtifactRecord, node registration/heartbeat). flashnode
  and flashml-cloud import it.
- `backends/` = `ExecutionBackend` contract + working `KubeRayExecutionBackend`
  (JobSpec → RayJob CR, status mapping, event normalization). Pins: KubeRay
  chart 1.6.2, Ray 2.46.0.
- `artifacts/` = ArtifactStore protocol; MinIO (S3-compatible) + native OSS.
- `service/` = FastAPI runtime API (:8100) + SQLite ledger + `flashruntime` CLI.
- `flashml_workloads/sharded_kmeans.py` = the POC's Ray workload (deterministic
  shards, retriable tasks, honest recovery evidence).
- `deploy/docker/` = kmeans + service images. `docs/adr/` = ACK Edge + PAI-DLC ADRs.
- `scheduler/` = `PlacementPolicy` ABC + `FifoPlacement` + `IsolationAwarePlacement`
  (fail-closed sandbox placement for service-side command tasks). No scaffold
  packages remain; the numpy prototype engine has been removed.
- `planner/` + `protocol/plan_v1alpha1.py` = the strategy planner (July
  2026): `flash.plan(PlanRequest)` → explained `PlanReport`/`StrategyPlan`;
  CLI `flashruntime plan spec.yaml`. Deterministic, framework-import-free,
  curated menu (single_gpu/ddp/fsdp2/zero3_cpu_offload + QLoRA variants,
  lease_tasks for Mode A). Walkthrough: `docs/planner/README.md`. Estimator
  constants live in `planner/catalog.py`; the arithmetic is pinned by
  `tests/test_planner.py` — change formulas only with justification against
  workspace-root `FLASHRUNTIME_EVALUATION.md`.
- `leases/` = the Mode A state machine (July 2026): `LeaseManager` with
  claim/heartbeat/expiry-sweep/idempotent-commit, injectable clock, typed
  Event emission, `LeaseStore` seam (InMemory + restart-durable `SqliteLeaseStore`).
- `checkpoint/` = `CheckpointCatalog` (July 2026): parts-first /
  manifest-last commit, validation ladder (hash→restore-verified→invalid),
  topology-compatible `latest_valid()`, `lost_work()` economics.
- `recovery/` = `classify(FailureSignals)` precedence taxonomy +
  `decide(failure, mode)` versioned policy table (POLICY_VERSION); total
  over FailureClass × mode, correlated incidents freeze automation.
- **Core is pydantic-only**: `import flashruntime` + planner/leases/
  checkpoint/recovery must never require numpy/k8s/minio/fastapi (verified
  by a clean-venv smoke; the bring-your-own-code SDK helpers are lazy via
  PEP 562 `__getattr__` so the core import stays minimal). Keep it that way.
- `service/` Mode A surface (July 2026): LeaseManager over HTTP
  (`/v1alpha1/leases/claim`, `/attempts/{id}/{heartbeat,complete,fail}`),
  minimal node registry (`/nodes/*` — self-hosted profile; cloud fronts it
  with join codes later), **local artifact hosting** (`PUT|GET
  /v1alpha1/artifacts/{key}` under FLASHML_LOCAL_ARTIFACTS_DIR),
  `hyperparameter_search` job→task expansion (`service/modea.py`,
  `execution.backend: leases`), derived job states + 2 s sweeper, and a
  self-contained dashboard at `GET /` (`service/dashboard.py`). KubeRay is
  optional: `FLASHML_ENABLE_KUBERAY=0` runs the coordinator cloud-free.
- `workloads/` + `flash.submit` = bring-your-own-code (July 2026):
  `CommandWorkload` (framework-neutral "run this command"; `argv()`,
  `to_jobspec()`) + `flash.submit(workload, output_dir=None) → Run`
  (synchronous local compile→launch→wait→collect). First concrete
  launcher (`launchers/local.py`), recipe (`recipes/command.py`), and
  strategy compiler (`strategies/command.py` — a function, not a
  `StrategyCompiler`, since a StrategyPlan carries no argv). Thin
  framework adapters in `integrations/` (sklearn sweeps, pytorch DDP, HF
  Trainer callback — no framework imports at module level) + the optional
  in-script `flashruntime.torch` helper (3 verbs + read-only accessors incl.
  `device()`/`backend()` — capability guardrail, not a count: prepare/
  checkpoint/log_metrics/rank/world_size/is_main/start_step; wraps torch's
  own DDP and stops — ADR-0003 guardrail). Service-side command jobs expand
  + lease with fail-closed sandbox placement (`scheduler.IsolationAwarePlacement`);
  **executing** the `argv` payload is wired end-to-end: flashnode's argv
  runner tier (cross-repo, `flashnode work --runner argv`) runs the task's
  argv inside a hardened, network-isolated container and commits the result.
  User-facing guides: `docs/guides/bring-your-code.md` (job authors) and
  `docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md` (volunteer node operators).
- **Volunteer compute pool: argv runner tier** (July 2026, cross-repo):
  any machine can join with `flashnode work --runner argv --coordinator
  <URL>`, which requires a non-empty `FLASHNODE_ALLOWED_IMAGES` and refuses
  to start otherwise (never degrades to an unsandboxed tier). Runs the
  task's pinned image + argv inside `ArgvDockerRunner` with `--network none`,
  `--read-only`, a `noexec,nosuid` `/tmp` tmpfs, non-root `--user`,
  `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, `--pids-limit`,
  `--cpus`/`--memory` (`--memory-swap` pinned equal), and `--ulimit
  nofile`; only the bound workdir (`/work`) is writable. Wall-clock timeout
  kills the named container directly, not just the local `docker` client.
  `argv_capable` is a new fail-closed field on `NodeRegistration` (not
  `NodeCapabilities` — it is a runner posture, not a hardware fact);
  `IsolationAwarePlacement` requires **both** `sandbox_capable` and
  `argv_capable` before leasing a command task to a node, and the
  `allowFallback` waiver cannot bypass that gate. `CommandRecipe` rejects
  `isolation.tier != "sandboxed"` for command jobs (coordinator-side escape
  hatch only: `FLASHML_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED_ARGV=1`) — a submitter can never
  downgrade their own isolation. The composite `(job_id, task_id)` lease key
  (both `InMemoryLeaseStore` and `SqliteLeaseStore`, with an in-place SQLite
  migration from the old single-column primary key) landed alongside this so
  a multi-job volunteer pool doesn't collide two jobs' `task-000`. **Known
  gaps, documented in `docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md`:** no result
  verification (a lying node is currently believed), one shared join code,
  container escape is not ruled out (shared host kernel), disk fill capped
  only at upload time, no GPU probing, no coordinated multi-process training
  on volunteer nodes, and the real-Docker integration tests are currently
  skipped (no daemon in the dev environment) — the hardening is verified by
  constructed-argv assertions, not yet by a live daemon.
- **Automatic recovery in the SDK** (July 2026): `flash.submit(...,
  max_restarts=N)` turns a FAILED attempt into `FailureSignals`, calls
  `recovery.classify()`/`decide()`, and — unless the failure is a
  deterministic app error (FAIL_JOB, fast-stop) — relaunches from the
  job-scoped checkpoint. Decisions surface as `FAILURE_CLASSIFIED` /
  `RECOVERY_ACTION_SELECTED` events on the run (`sdk.py`). This is the
  SDK-local path; the *service coordinator* still recovers via implicit
  lease-expiry (classify/decide uncalled there).
- **Live run viewer** (`viewer/`, July 2026): a stdlib, zero-CDN HTML page
  served on loopback during a watched run (KPI dashboard strip, machine →
  worker → rank process flow map with click-in detail panel, loss +
  resource charts, verified checkpoints, recovery feed; telemetry from
  `monitor/` ResourceSampler — optional psutil via the `[monitor]` extra —
  and per-rank heartbeat files from `flashruntime.torch`), reading only
  the versioned `run.json` (`viewer_v1`) contract. `flash.submit(watch=…)`
  opens it (auto: on at a TTY, off in pipes/CI); the built docs site is
  served from it at `/docs`.
- **Docs site + benchmarks** (July 2026): PyTorch-style site under
  `docs/site/`, built by `scripts/build_docs.py` (every byte inline;
  `--check` link-verifies), deployed to GitHub Pages on release. Honest
  benchmark suite (`python -m benchmarks run`): each result records its
  host, missing comparators are skipped rows not fakes; measured Apple-M4
  baseline committed under `benchmarks/results/`.
- **Real-GPU validation (2026-07-23):** the CUDA paths (nccl DDP, per-rank
  device placement, GPU kill-and-resume) validated on **2×RTX 4090**
  (RunPod community cloud, torch 2.7.1+cu128, CUDA 12.8), $0.0725 total.
  `tests/test_gpu_e2e.py` (CUDA-gated, skips without a GPU); harness
  `scripts/runpod_gpu_e2e.py` (`--plan-only` dry-run). It found a real
  GPU-only bug the CPU/gloo suite could not: batches must move to
  `ft.device()`.
- **Release engineering** (July 2026): CI matrix (Python 3.10–3.13 ×
  ubuntu/macos) with a pydantic-only core-smoke job, a docs link-check, and
  a bench-smoke; tag-triggered release (PyPI Trusted Publishing, test-gated,
  + GitHub Pages); `scripts/audit_secrets.sh` (worktree + history scan,
  CLEAN); `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `SECURITY.md` / `CHANGELOG.md`; PEP 561
  `py.typed`, built docs bundled in the wheel.
- Tests: `pytest` → **317 passed, 1 skipped** (the CUDA-gated GPU test),
  20 deselected (integration + bench_smoke, opt-in via `-m`; live in
  `tests/integration/` with env auto-skip). `flashnode`'s own suite:
  **60 passed, 1 skipped**. Images: `deploy/docker/`.
  Full-loop proof: workspace-root `e2e/` (`make e2e`, `make e2e-demo`) +
  in-repo `tests/test_examples_e2e.py` (4 real bring-your-code e2e tests,
  incl. kill-at-40 → auto-resume, final loss matching baseline to 1e-6).
  POC runbook: workspace-root
  `archive/POC_PLAN.md` + Makefile.

## Status vs. plan (what's done, what's missing)

Architecture decisions: `docs/adr/0003-…` + workspace-root
`FLASHRUNTIME_EVALUATION.md`; execution log: workspace-root `PROGRESS.md`.

**Done (July 2026, deploy-ready milestone):** the 0.1.0 feature set.
Bring-your-own-code SDK (`flash.submit(CommandWorkload)`) + `flashruntime
submit`/`submit-spec` CLI; sklearn/pytorch/HF integration adapters +
optional `flashruntime.torch` helper; automatic SDK recovery (`max_restarts`
→ classify/decide, one-call kill-and-resume proven in
`tests/test_examples_e2e.py`); live run viewer opening on `--watch`;
PyTorch-style docs site (built + served at `/docs` + Pages-ready); honest
benchmark suite + measured M4 baseline; CI matrix + test-gated trusted
publishing + secrets audit CLEAN; real-GPU validation (2×RTX 4090, nccl,
$0.0725); volunteer compute pool argv runner tier (cross-repo — any machine
can join with `flashnode work --runner argv`, executing arbitrary
sandboxed argv inside a hardened, network-isolated container, gated by a
composite `(job_id, task_id)` lease key and the `argv_capable` placement
gate). Earlier local-milestone core still stands: Mode A lease
coordinator over HTTP (claim/heartbeat/complete/fail; commit-time sha256
validation; join-code registration; artifact size caps); durable
`SqliteLeaseStore` (in-flight leases survive restarts); job→task expansion
for `hyperparameter_search`/`sharded_kmeans`; checkpoint HTTP surface;
`flashml_workloads/` task modules; dashboard at GET /; the planner. Proven
by workspace-root `e2e/` (kill-a-machine sweep, K-means convergence,
cross-machine resume). Suite: **237 passed, 1 skipped, 9 deselected**.

**Missing (in rough priority order):**
1. **Multi-node DDP rendezvous** — `nnodes > 1` in the pytorch adapter
   raises `NotImplementedError` today; single-node (`--standalone`) is the
   proven path. GPU is validated single-node; multi-node GPU rendezvous is
   a later launcher slice. Not planned for volunteer nodes at all — see
   `docs/guides/donate-a-machine.md`.
2. **Checkpoint-manifest persistence** — catalog is in-memory; checkpoint
   *files* are durable, so manifests die with the coordinator.
3. **Stage-8 ledger metrics** (MTTD/MTTR/goodput/lost-work) + case study —
   every needed event already exists.
4. Service-side recovery wiring — the SDK path fires classify/decide +
   FAILURE_CLASSIFIED / RECOVERY_ACTION_SELECTED, but the *coordinator*
   still recovers via implicit lease-expiry.
5. `flash.run(plan)` — planner and executor exist but aren't linked (raises
   `NotImplementedError`); e2e plans then builds the JobSpec by hand.
6. Cloud stage: Postgres (same append-only schema), SSE instead of
   polling, ACK/KubeRay hybrid pool, HF Trainer + PEFT LoRA recipes on the
   sgd_trainer checkpoint contract.
7. **Volunteer-pool trust hardening** — per-node identity replacing the
   shared join code (slice B), result verification for untrusted nodes
   (slice C), GPU capability probing (slice D), and real-Docker
   verification of the sandbox flags (the integration tests are written but
   currently skip for lack of a Docker daemon in the dev environment).
