class FakeCoordinator:
    """Stands in for the HTTP coordinator.

    `commits[r]` lists entries for round r: either `(shard, delta_value,
    samples)`, or `(shard, delta_value, samples, loss)` when a test needs to
    pin a specific per-shard loss. A shard absent from a round never
    commits — that is how a straggler or a closed laptop is simulated.

    `reveal_at` optionally staggers when a shard's commit becomes visible:
    `{shard: n}` means that shard's artifacts are absent from `artifacts()`
    until strictly more than `n` calls have been made, simulating a commit
    that lands mid-poll rather than being present from the first tick. A
    shard with no entry (the default) is visible immediately, matching the
    original behavior. This lets a test construct a genuine pre-quorum tick
    with a partial, sub-quorum commit set — something an all-or-nothing
    fake can never produce, and therefore can never use to catch an
    implementation that fetches deltas from inside the poll loop instead of
    once after quorum.

    `extra_keys` ({round: [key, ...]}) injects artifact keys that no task in
    the round legitimately owns — the recursive upload of a nested output
    tree, or a key naming a shard index beyond `num_shards`.

    `completed` ({round: [shard, ...]}) decouples "uploaded an artifact"
    from "the coordinator ACCEPTED the commit". Uploads happen before the
    commit is offered, so an attempt the coordinator rejected still leaves
    its metrics.json behind; by default every committed shard is reported
    COMPLETED, which is the honest case.
