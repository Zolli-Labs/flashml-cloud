"""Weight/delta encoding and the federated-averaging reduce.

Weights cross the wire as JSON so the driver never imports torch: it runs
inside the cloud API (spec §5.4.5), which must stay a light service. Only
`fedavg_worker` needs torch, and it converts at the boundary.

    {"<param>": {"shape": [int, ...], "data": [float, ...]}}

`data` is the flattened tensor in row-major order; `shape` restores it.
Pure stdlib on purpose — same rule as kmeans_shard and sgd_trainer, so
this module runs on any device, including inside a --network none
container.
