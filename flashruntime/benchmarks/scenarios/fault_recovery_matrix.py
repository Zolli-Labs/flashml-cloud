"""fault_recovery_matrix — does automated recovery do the RIGHT typed thing
across a spread of failure modes, or only on the one crash we rehearsed?

HYPOTHESIS: flashruntime handles a diverse fault matrix — a deterministic bug,
a mid-run crash, a worker killed mid-run by an external SIGKILL, a kill inside
the checkpoint write window, and a corrupt checkpoint — CORRECTLY and without a
human: fail-fast on the bug,
auto-resume from the newest VALID checkpoint on the rest. A bare torchrun does
none of it (every fault needs a person).

MEASUREMENT METHOD (auditable from this file alone):
  Five injected faults, each a real local ``flash.submit`` run. Correctness is
  COUNTED from observable run state — the terminal state, the number of attempts,
  and ``trials[0].resumed_from`` (which manifest step the resume actually
  restored) — never a ``try/assert`` that predetermines the score. The headline
  ``median`` is that count out of five; a case that measures as mishandled lowers
  it and is a FINDING, not a test to fix. Per-case verdicts ship in ``notes``.

  Comparator: the same mid-run crash (case b) under BARE torchrun argv (from the
  pytorch adapter) — it dies with no retry, and its recovery cost is MODELLED as
  ``t_crash + t_full`` (no checkpoint ⇒ rerun from zero), labelled modelled, the
  same house convention as recovery_economics. A missing torchrun is a note, not
  a skip: this scenario measures flashruntime, which needs no torch.
