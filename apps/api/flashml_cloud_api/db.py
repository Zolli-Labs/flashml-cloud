"""Thin Postgres access for the FlashML Cloud API.

Every function that reads or writes rows scoped to a specific owner takes
that owner as an explicit parameter and folds it into the query itself —
never as a filter applied afterwards in Python. That way a query cannot
return (or mutate) another user's rows by omission: leaving out the owner
is a missing function argument, not a missing ``if``.

``db`` throughout this module (and in ``enrolment.py``) is a live psycopg
connection opened by ``connect()``. Connections are opened in autocommit
mode so every statement (or, where noted, every atomically-scoped ``UPDATE
... RETURNING``) takes effect immediately and callers never need to
remember a ``commit()``.
