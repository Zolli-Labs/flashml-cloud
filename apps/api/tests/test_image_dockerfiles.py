"""Task 1 of the Windows-hosts plan: the curated images must each declare a
non-root ``USER`` as their last user-affecting instruction.

This is the safety prerequisite for Task 2 (flashnode/flashnode/executor/
hardening.py making ``--user`` platform-conditional). Windows omits
``--user`` because ``os.getuid``/``os.getgid`` don't exist there; that is
only safe if the image itself already runs as non-root. These tests parse
the Dockerfiles directly (no Docker daemon needed) so they run everywhere,
including CI without a build step.

See ``../../images/README.md`` and
``../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-01-windows-hosts.md`` ("The trap at
the centre of this plan").
